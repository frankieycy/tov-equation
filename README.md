## TOV Equation

* solve Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff (TOV) equation with RK4
* for neutron stars in equilibrium

## Theory

* a set of 4 equations
* (i) dp/dr, (ii) dm/dr, (iii) EOS(rho,p), (iv) EOS(e,rho,p)
* resp: `dp()`, `dm()`, `density()`, `energy()`
* to completely fix a solution, require init condition: center density `rho0`, i.e. rho(r=0)

## Code

* iter till dp>p or dm>m
* because physically p,m must be positive
* sol for diff init `rho0` are calc, obtaining: total mass M & radius R
* M-R curve is plotted, showing possible states of a stable neutron star

## Outputs

* `data.csv`: radius,pressure,mass,density,energy (data for a fixed `rho0`)
* `mr.csv`: rho0,mass,radius (data for a range of `rho0`)
* plots generated by python codes
